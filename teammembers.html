                    I'm currently a senior computer science student at CSU Bakersfield. Within computer science, I am most drawn to artificial intelligence. However, my academic path isn't solely defined by computer science, it also includes a substantial background in geology, represented by both a bachelor's and master's degree. Today, I am looking to integrate my extensive understanding of geology and my emerging expertise in artificial intelligence. My ultimate goal is to bring innovation to the energy industry by applying the knowledge and skills I've picked up.
