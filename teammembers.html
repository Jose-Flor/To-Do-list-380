                    I'm currently a senior computer science student at CSU Bakersfield. Within computer science, I am most drawn to artificial intelligence. However, my academic path isn't solely defined by computer science, it also includes a substantial background in geology, represented by both a bachelor's and master's degree. Today, I am looking to integrate my extensive understanding of geology and my emerging expertise in artificial intelligence. My ultimate goal is to bring innovation to the energy industry by applying the knowledge and skills I've picked up.

                    I'm currently a senior Physics student at California State University, Chico with a double minor in Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm mostly interested in the interface between hardware electronics and the software that runs on them. I also am very interested in technical computing and scientific software simulation for complex physical systems. With my background in Physics and Computer Science, I hope to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering to specialize in embedded systems.

                    I am a Computer Science major at CSUN. I am planning to graduate by Spring 2024, however I have not come up with an idea of what I want to do. My biggest strengths are html and css. My favorite heroes are Ultraman, Kamen Rider, and Super Sentai. I am getting myself into real estate and have been interested in making websites. I have a lot to think about in the future, but I know I will be successful.

                    I'm a Senior Computer Engineer student at CSUN. I am pursuing Computer Engineering as my backup plan, but I also have extensive experience in website development, SEO, and marketing. I am excited to leverage my understanding of e-commerce in the field, especially considering the significant impact of AI in this space. I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to the mix of technology and business, where I can make a meaningful impact.
